# Shopify App Examples

This repository is home to the code examples highlighted in various [Shopify API tutorials](http://docs.myshopify.io/api/tutorials/). They are designed solely for the purposes of introducing new developers to the Shopify API. This apps are written in [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra), but the concepts presented will also apply to developers building applications in other languages such as Python, Node.js and PHP.

## Tutorial index

#### 01 Getting Started
- Building a public Shopify application ([tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/api/tutorials/building-public-app))

## Requirements

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (sample apps were written with Ruby 2.2.1)
* [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download), the package management tool for Ruby
* [Bundler for Ruby](http://bundler.io/), a dependency manager

## Installation

* Download the sample code from the [this repo](https://github.com/Shopify/example-ruby-app)
* To get the necessary dependencies, navigate to the application folder and type `bundle install`

## Credentials

To create a public app and retrieve your API credentials, sign up for a [Shopify Partners account](https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/auth/login) and [follow this guide](https://help.shopify.com/api/guides/api-credentials).

This tutorial series uses a `.env` file to store application credentials.  For each installment in the series there is a corresponding app directory and `app.rb` file.  When following the tutorials, make sure the app directory includes a `.env` file with contents as follows:
```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
API_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

where `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` are the values of your application's API key and secret key respectively.

## App URL

This tutorial series using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel from the public Internet to your local machine.  For each installment in the series, you will need to copy the `APP_URL` generated by ngrok to your `app.rb` file.  Additionally, the `APP_URL` needs to be added to the **App URLs** section of your public app settings.  These procedures are covered in part one of the tutorials.

## Running the apps

Each installment of the tutorials includes an app.rb file inside the app directory.  To initialize an app, navigate to the correct app directory in terminal and then run `ruby app.rb`.
